# Linux on Google Pixel 3a (Bonito &amp; Sargo) 
Instructions on how to install Droidian, Manjaro ARM and UBPorts on Google Pixel 3a and 3a XL (Bonito & Sargo)

## Android 9
<p>For all 3 systems, Android 9 is required. 
   <br><b>BEWARE:</b> Installing and downgrading to Android 9 will wipe your entire phone.</p>

## Download
<p>TWRP (latest .img - rename it twrp.img) - https://dl.twrp.me/sargo/

```fastboot devices```
5. Now type the following command to unlock the bootloader: ```fastboot flashing unlock``` 
6. If the device doesnâ€™t automatically reboot, reboot it. It should now be unlocked.

## Flash Android 9
You will need to flash Android on both A & B partitions. Open the terminal inside the download Android 9 folder.
